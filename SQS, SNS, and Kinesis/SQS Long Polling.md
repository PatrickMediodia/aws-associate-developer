 - when a consumer requests for messages from the queue, it can optionally wait for messages to arrive if there are none in the queue
 - it fine to wait since there are no messages
 - `Long Polling` 
	 - decreases the number of API calls made to SQS thus increasing the efficiency 
	 - and decreasing the latency of your application
		 - if during the wait a message arrives, it will be processed immediately
- set between 1 seconds and 20 seconds
	- 20 seconds is preferrable
- `long polling` is preferable to short polling
	- if question is too many calls to SQS queue and is costing them money and cpu cycle and increasing the latency, then long polling might be the answer
- can be enabled at the queue level or at the API level using `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`
